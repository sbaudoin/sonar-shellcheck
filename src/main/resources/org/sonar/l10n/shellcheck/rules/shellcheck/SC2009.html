<p>SC2009 Consider using pgrep instead of grepping ps output.</p>
<h2>Problematic Code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">ps ax | grep -v grep | grep &quot;$service&quot; &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct Code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">pgrep -f &quot;$service&quot; &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>If you are just after a pid from a running program, then pgrep is a much safer alternative. Especially if you are also looking for a pid belonging to a certain user or group. All of the parameters are in one command and it can eliminate multiple greps, cuts, seds, awks, etc.</p>
<p>If you want a field that's not the pid, consider doing this through <code>ps</code> + <code>pgrep</code> instead of <code>ps</code> + <code>grep</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for pid in $(pgrep '^python$')
do
  user=$(ps -o user= -p "$pid")
  echo "The process $pid is run by $user"
done
</code></pre>
<p>This is more robust than <code>ps .. | grep python | cut ..</code> because it does not try to match against unrelated fields, such as if the user's name was <code>pythonguru</code>.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>You can [[ignore]] this error if you are trying to match against something that <code>pgrep</code> doesn't support:</p>
<pre><code># pgrep does not support filtering by 'nice' value
# shellcheck disable=SC2009
ps -axo nice=,pid= | grep -v '^  0'
</code></pre>
