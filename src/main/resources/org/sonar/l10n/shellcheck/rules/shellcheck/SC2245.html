<p>-d only applies to the first expansion of this glob. Use a loop to check any/all.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">if [ -f ksh* ]
then
  echo &quot;The file exists&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">for f in ksh*
do
  if [ -f &quot;$f&quot; ]
  then
    echo &quot;Found a matching file: $f&quot;
  fi
done
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Ksh has the curious behavior of ignoring anything after an unrecognized flag to <code>test</code>/<code>[</code>, which means that file checking operators against globs will effectively apply the operator to the first expansion:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">[ -f ksh* ]                              # This
[ -f ksh93u ksh93u.tar ksh93u.tar.gz ]   # Becomes this
[ -f ksh93u ]                            # And is interpreted like this
</code></pre>
<p>This is an issue when you have multiple matches for a glob. Instead of checking some or all, it only checks the first result and ignores the rest. To ensure that all results are considered (either to check that <em>any</em> or <em>all</em> results match the operator), use a loop explicitly.</p>
<p>If you really only want to match the first result of the glob expansion as sorted alphabetically in the current locale, you can make this intention explicit:</p>
<pre><code>matches=( ksh* )
if [ -f "${matches[0]}" ]
then
  echo "The first result is a file"
fi
</code></pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you only care that entries exists, use <code>-e</code>. ShellCheck does not warn in this case, since all files resulting from glob expansion necessarily exist.</p>
