<p>In POSIX sh, redirecting from/to globs is undefined.</p>
<p>(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using <code>dash</code>)</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">#!/bin/sh
date &gt; /tmp/log*.txt
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<p>To redirect from/to the only match of a glob, expand the glob first:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">#!/bin/sh
set -- /tmp/log*.txt
# PS: This is a good place to verify that there was exactly one match
date &gt; &quot;$1&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, use a loop to redirect from/to all if that was the intention.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Shells differ in whether (and how) they do pathname expansion on names in redirections. Avoid the issue by expanding the glob yourself.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.</p>
<p>You can use <code># shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000</code> to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.</p>
