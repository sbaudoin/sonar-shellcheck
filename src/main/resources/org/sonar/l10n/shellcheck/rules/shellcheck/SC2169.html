<p>In dash, <em>something</em> is not supported.</p>
<p>You are writing a script for <code>dash</code>, but you're using a feature that <code>dash</code> doesn't support. See [[SC2039]], the equivalent warning for POSIX sh, for possible workarounds.</p>
<p>See also Ubuntu's <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh">DashAsBinSh</a> migration guide for how to make bash-specific scripts dash-compatible.</p>
