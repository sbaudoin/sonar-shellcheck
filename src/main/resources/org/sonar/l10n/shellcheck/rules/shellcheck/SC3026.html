<p>In POSIX sh, ^ in place of ! in glob bracket expressions is undefined.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo foo-[^0]*.jpg
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo foo-[!0]*.jpg
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p><code>[^c]</code> is frequently used in most regular expression variants to mean "any character except <code>c</code>". Ksh and Bash adopted it for globs as well.</p>
<p>However, strictly speaking, the only range complement syntax guaranteed to be supported across shells is <code>[!c]</code>. Dash only supports it when using <code>fnmatch</code> and <code>glob</code> from glibc.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.
Or just rewrite it to be on the technically correct side.</p>
