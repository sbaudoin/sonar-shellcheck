<p>This translated string is the name of a variable. Flip leading $ and " if this should be a quoted substitution.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">var=&quot;foo&quot;
echo $&quot;var&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">var=&quot;foo&quot;
echo &quot;$var&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p><code>$".."</code> is a localized string, for example, <code>echo $"Hello $USER"</code> along with the proper translation files can be used to have the script say "Bonjour, youruser" in French locales.</p>
<p>In this case, ShellCheck found a localized string whose contents is also the name of a variable. This could have happened because the user wanted a far more common quoted substitution, e.g. <code>"$var"</code>, but accidentally switched the leading <code>$</code> and <code>"</code>.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you do want a localized string whose contents is also an active variable, you can [[ignore]] this warning or rename the variable.</p>
