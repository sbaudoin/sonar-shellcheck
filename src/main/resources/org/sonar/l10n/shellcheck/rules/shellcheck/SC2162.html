<p>read without -r will mangle backslashes</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo &quot;Enter name:&quot;
read name
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo &quot;Enter name:&quot;
read -r name
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>By default, <code>read</code> will interpret backslashes before spaces and line feeds, and otherwise strip them. This is rarely expected or desired.</p>
<p>Normally you just want to read data, which is what <code>read -r</code> does. You should always use <code>-r</code> unless you have a good reason not to.</p>
<p>Note that <code>read -r</code> will still strip leading and trailing spaces. <code>IFS="" read -r</code> prevents this.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you want backslashes to affect field splitting and line terminators instead of being read, you can disable this message with a [[directive]].</p>
