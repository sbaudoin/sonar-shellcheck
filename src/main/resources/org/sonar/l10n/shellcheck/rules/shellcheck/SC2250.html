<h1>Prefer putting braces around variable references even when not strictly required.</h1>
<p>This error is optional and not enabled by default.</p>
<p>Problematic code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">partial_path=&#39;example&#39;

curl &quot;http://example.com/$partial_path_version/explain.html&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Correct code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">partial_path=&#39;example&#39;

curl &quot;http://example.com/${partial_path}_version/explain.html&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Rationale:</p>
<p>If a variable gets called, and there is a string that gets appended to the variable that could get misinterpreted as possibly part of the name of the variable. Then it will not call the right variable.</p>
