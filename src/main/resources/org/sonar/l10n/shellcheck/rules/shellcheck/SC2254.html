<p>Quote expansions in case patterns to match literally rather than as a glob.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">case $input in
  -       ) echo &quot;Reading from stdin...&quot; ;;
  $output ) echo &quot;Input should be different from output&quot; ;;
esac
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">case $input in
  -         ) echo &quot;Reading from stdin...&quot; ;;
  &quot;$output&quot; ) echo &quot;Input should be different from output&quot; ;;
esac
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>When unquoted variables and command expansions are used in case branch patterns, they will be interpreted as globs.</p>
<p>This can lead to some surprising behavior, such as <code>case $x in $x) trigger;; esac</code> not triggering in some cases, such as when <code>x='Pride and Prejudice [1813].epub'</code>.</p>
<p>To match the literal content of the variable or expansion, make sure to double quote the expansion.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you intended to match a dynamically generated pattern, you can ignore this suggestion with a directive.</p>
