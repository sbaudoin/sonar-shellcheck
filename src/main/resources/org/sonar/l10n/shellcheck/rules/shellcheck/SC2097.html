<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">name=World cmd -m &quot;Hello $name&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">name=World
cmd -m &quot;Hello $name&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If the original goal was to limit the scope of the variable, this can also be done in a subshell:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">(
   name=World
   cmd -m &quot;Hello $name&quot;
) # &#39;name&#39; does not leave this subshell
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>In <code>name=World cmd "$name"</code>, <code>name=World</code> is passed in as part of the environment to <code>cmd</code> (i.e., in the <code>envp</code> parameter to <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/execve">execve(2)</a>).  This means that <code>cmd</code> and its children will see the parameter, but no other processes will.</p>
<p>However, <code>"$name"</code> is not expanded by <code>cmd</code>. <code>"$name"</code> is expanded by the shell before <code>cmd</code> is ever executed, and thus it will not use the new value.</p>
<p>The solution is to set the variable first, then use it as a parameter. If limited scope is desired, a <code>( subshell )</code> can be used.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>In the strange and fabricated scenarios where the script and a program uses a variable name for two different purposes, you can ignore this message. This is hard to conceive, since scripts should use lowercase variable names specifically to avoid collisions with the environment.</p>
