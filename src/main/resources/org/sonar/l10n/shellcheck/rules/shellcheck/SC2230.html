<p>which is non-standard. Use builtin 'command -v' instead.</p>
<p>Note: This check is opt-in only in ShellCheck 0.7.1+ (<code>shellcheck -o deprecate-which</code>).</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">which grep
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"># For the path of a single, unaliased, external command,
# or to check whether this will just &quot;run&quot; in this shell:
command -v grep
# To check whether commands exist, without obtaining a reusable path:
hash grep
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p><code>which</code> is a non-standard, external tool that locates an executable in PATH. <code>command -v</code> is a POSIX standard builtin, which uses the same lookup mechanism that the shell itself would.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>This check is opt-in only in 0.7.1+, and you may choose to [[ignore]] it in earlier versions. <code>which</code> is very common, and some prefer its executable-or-nothing behavior over <code>command -v</code>'s handling of builtins, functions and aliases.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<h3><code>command -v</code> does not check ALL parameters</h3>
<p><code>command -v</code> succeeds (with exit code 0) if <em>any</em> command exists:</p>
<pre><code># grep is in /usr/bin/grep
# foobar is not in path
#
$ command -v -- grep foobar; echo $?
0
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, it should have failed and exited with 1 unless <em>all</em> commands
exist, if it were to be a replacement for <code>which</code>. Other problems associated with
<code>command</code> include its inclusion of builtins, aliases, and functions.</p>
<p>An alternative is:</p>
<pre><code>$ hash &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Which observes the standard behaviour of failures.</p>
<p>To obtain a path, <code>type -p</code> can be used instead. Like <code>command -v</code>, it has a similarly
quirky behavior with builtins, aliases, and functions, although this is
arguably milder since it would print nothing for these cases. The failure condition is
similar to <code>hash</code>.</p>
