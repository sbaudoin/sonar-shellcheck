<h1>$ is not used specially and should therefore be escaped.</h1>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo &quot;$&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo &quot;\$&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p><code>$</code> is special in double quotes, but there are some cases where it's interpreted literally:</p>
<ol>
<li>Following a backslash: <code>echo "\$"</code></li>
<li>In a context where the shell can't make sense of it, such as at the end of the string, (<code>"foo$"</code>) or before some constructs (<code>"$'foo'"</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid relying on strange and shell-specific behavior, any <code>$</code> intended to be literal should be escaped with a backslash.</p>
