<h1>Use ./*glob<em> or -- \</em>glob* so names with dashes won't become options.</h1>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code>rm *
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code>rm ./*
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>rm -- *
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Since files and arguments are strings passed the same way, programs can't properly determine which is which, and rely on dashes to determine what's what.</p>
<p>A file named <code>-f</code> (<code>touch -- -f</code>) will not be deleted by the problematic code. It will instead be interpreted as a command line option, and <code>rm</code> will even report success.</p>
<p>Using <code>./*</code> will instead cause the glob to be expanded into <code>./-f</code>, which no program will treat as an option.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>--</code> by convention indicates the end of options, and nothing after it will be treated like flags (except for some programs possibly still special casing <code>-</code> as e.g. stdin).</p>
<p>Note that changing <code>*</code> to <code>./*</code> in GNU Tar parameters will add <code>./</code> prefix to path names in the created archive. This may cause subtle problems (eg. to search for a specific file in archive, the <code>./</code> prefix must be specified as well). So using <code>-- *</code> is a safer fix for GNU Tar commands.</p>
<p><code>echo</code> and <code>printf</code> does not have issues unless the glob is the first word in the command. ShellCheck 0.7.2+ does not warn for these commands.</p>
