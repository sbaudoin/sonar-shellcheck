<p>Avoid x-prefix in comparisons as it no longer serves a purpose.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">[ &quot;x$pass&quot; = &quot;xswordfish&quot; ]

test x&quot;$var&quot; = x
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">[ &quot;$pass&quot; = &quot;swordfish&quot; ] 

test &quot;$var&quot; = &quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Some older shells would get confused if the first argument started with a dash, or consisted of <code>!</code> or <code>(</code>. As a workaround, people would prefix variables and values to be compared with <code>x</code> to ensure the left-hand side always started with an alphanumeric character.</p>
<p>POSIX ensures <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html">this is not necessary</a>, and all modern shells now follow suite.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Bash 1.14 from 1992 incorrectly fails this test. This was fixed for Bash 2.0 in 1996:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">var=&#39;!&#39;
[ &quot;$var&quot; = &quot;!&quot; ]
</code></pre>
<p>Dash 0.5.4 from 2007 incorrectly passes this test. This was fixed for Dash 0.5.5 in 2008:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">x=&#39;(&#39; y=&#39;)&#39;
[ &quot;$x&quot; = &quot;$y&quot; ]
</code></pre>
<p>Zsh (while not supported by ShellCheck) fixed the same problem in 2015.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you are targeting especially old shells, you can ignore this warning (or use a different letter).</p>
