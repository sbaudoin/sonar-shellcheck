<p><code>(</code> is invalid here. Did you forget to escape it?</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo (foo) bar
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<p>Depends on your intention:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo &quot;(foo) bar&quot;  # Literal parentheses
echo &quot;$(foo) bar&quot; # Command expansion
echo &quot;foo bar&quot;    # Tried to use parentheses for grouping or function invocation
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck expected an ordinary shell word but found an opening parenthesis instead.</p>
<p>Determine what you intended the parenthesis to do and rewrite accordingly. Common issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanting them to be literal, as in <code>echo (FAIL) Some tests failed</code>. In this case, it requires quoting.</li>
<li>Wanting command expansion, as in <code>echo Today is (date)</code>. Add the missing <code>$</code>: <code>echo "Today is $(date)"</code></li>
<li>Adding parentheses because other languages need them in that context, such as <code>foo (bar, 42)</code> to call a function. This should be <code>foo bar 42</code>. Also, shells do not support tuples or passing arrays as single parameters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Bash allows some parentheses as part of assignment-like tokens to certain commands, including <code>export</code> and <code>eval</code>. This is a workaround in Bash to allow commands that normally would not be valid:</p>
<pre><code>eval foo=(bar)       # Valid command
echo foo=(bar)       # Invalid syntax
f=foo; eval $f=(bar) # Also invalid
</code></pre>
<p>In these cases, please quote the command, such as `eval "foo=(bar)". This does not change the behavior, but stops relying on bash specific parsing quirks.</p>
