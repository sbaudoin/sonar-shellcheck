<p>In POSIX sh, $(&lt;file) is undefined.</p>
<p>(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using <code>dash</code>)</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">content=$(&lt;file)
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">content=$(cat file)
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>In bash and ksh, <code>$(&lt; file)</code> will expand to the full contents of the file.</p>
<p>However, in dash and POSIX sh, it will instead expand to nothing. This is because it's not recognized as special, and simply results in the command output of <code>&lt; file</code>, a no-op command that opens the file and exits without reading it.</p>
